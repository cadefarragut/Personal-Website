                    <p> Hello, my name is Cade Farragut, I am from Spring, Texas. Right now, I'm Currently a student at Louisiana State University 
                        pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Growing up playing sports, I picked up important values like dedication, discipline, and commitment. 
                        It has also blessed me with a burning desire to work hard and win, no matter what field I am on. In my off time is where I grew a passion for Computers and all other forms of technology. 
                        With my work ethic and love for technology, I knew Computer Engineering was perfect for me. I am always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and improve my technical skills!
